# Website for Price Chart

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2 : Interactive Front End Development

Price Chart is a website designed to provide users with the ability to search for real-time and historical data for stocks, foreign exchange and crypto-currency prices and view this data on a chart. The website will be easy to navigate and the information will be simple to comprehend by users who are familiar with and also those who are not so familiar with financial data.

## UX

## Strategy

The price chart website is for users who are looking for real-time and historical data on stocks, foreign exchange and crypto-currency prices.The users may be interested in viewing this data for their own personal reasons like investing or trading, or they may want to view this data for research they may be performing as part of a project for a college course. The website will be simple to navigate and the data will be presented in a clear and easy to read format. As this website will only contain basic stock data it is targeted towards users with less experience with financial data as it may not be suited for experienced traders who are looking for more comprehensive data for their analysis, however, the website will have a professional feel to it and the data will be accurate so it is not strictly limited to beginners. The users of the price chart website will want to see clean and clearly labeled charts (price, date, time, stock name) that will not cause them any confusion with only relevant information being displayed to the user.
