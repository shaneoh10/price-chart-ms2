# Website for Price Chart

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2 : Interactive Front End Development

Price Chart is a website designed to provide users with the ability to search for real-time and historical data for stocks, foreign exchange and crypto-currency prices and view this data on a chart. The website will be easy to navigate and the information will be simple to comprehend by users who are familiar with and also those who are not so familiar with financial data.

## UX

## Strategy

The price chart website is for users who are looking for real-time and historical data on stocks, foreign exchange and crypto-currency prices.The users may be interested in viewing this data for their own personal reasons like investing or trading, or they may want to view this data for research they may be performing as part of a project for a college course. The website will be simple to navigate and the data will be presented in a clear and easy to read format. As this website will only contain basic stock data it is targeted towards users with less experience with financial data as it may not be suited for experienced traders who are looking for more comprehensive data for their analysis, however, the website will have a professional feel to it and the data will be accurate so it is not strictly limited to beginners. The users of the price chart website will want to see clean and clearly labeled charts (price, date, time, stock name) that will not cause them any confusion with only relevant information being displayed to the user.

#### As a user I want to:
* be able to instinctively navigate the website to efficienty find the required information
* be able to understand what the site is about and how it works
* easily search for and view price charts for stocks, foreign exchange and crypto-currencies
* be able to choose different time intervals on the price charts
* be able to view the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* be able to easily contact price chart with any questions or issues I am have regarding the website
* be easily directed to any social media channels to remain up to date with price chart

## Scope 

After analysing the user stories, I have decided to include the following features as my minimum scope:
* Responsive design
* Information on how the website works
* Individual sections for stocks, crypto-currency and foreign exchange (forex)
* Price charts for each section with buttons to choose time interval of chart
* Contact form
* Social media links in footer

## Structure 

I did some research on other websites that provide stock data and price charts to give me an idea of what users are familiar with. During my research I found that some websites provide a lot of data which may be difficult to understand and can be intimidating to less experienced users. Because of this I decided to design the website in a traditional manner similar to what I found on my research but with just the basic price data in the chart sections so as not to give users an overload of information. The website is designed to be easy to navigate and all information is displayed in a clean manner so that users will have a familiar and enjoyable experience.

I have structuted the website with: 
* A brand logo on the top left with a navbar to the right as is common to most websites
* A collapsible navbar with a hamburger icon for smaller screens
* 5 seperate pages - Home, Stocks, Forex, Crypto, Contact
* Navbar and footer common to all 5 pages
* Social media icons in the footer
* Main content written in bootstrap for responsive design

## Skeleton 

I designed wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq. These wireframes can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/shaneoh10/price-chart-ms2/tree/master/assets/documents/wireframes)
